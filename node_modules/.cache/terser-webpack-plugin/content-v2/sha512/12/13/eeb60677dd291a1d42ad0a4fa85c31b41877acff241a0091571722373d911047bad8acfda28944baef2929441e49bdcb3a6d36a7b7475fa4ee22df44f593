Other things to know about me: I'm a very family oriented person, I've never had a pet and really really want a Rottweiler, I can cook (but mostly just Korean cuisine), I love eating (it brings me the most happiness), and I wear sweaters/hoodies probably 99% of the time. Ty for reading my bio! :)))\"},{name:\"Edward Chanquin\",headshot:\"\",funnyPhoto:\"\",bio:\"Hey! Dunno why you picked me but let’s get my bio ready!  My name is Edward and I'm from South Central Los Angeles. My favorite TV shows are very different but good at the same time: Bones, Steven Universe, and Banana Fish. I would love to travel to Thailand and Japan, and somewhere in Latin America as well (Maybe Barcelona). I love playing volleyball, watching anime, and dancing. My Zodiac sign is an Aries, so caps and taurus stay away lol (jk). What makes me happy is eating Thai and Salvadorian food (shoutout to my pupusa lovers).\"},{name:\"Kate Mathew\",headshot:\"\",funnyPhoto:\"\",bio:\"Hey everyone, I’m Kate! I’m from the Bay Area, so as you can tell I went super far away for school and have no bias to California whatsoever. I love to create, whether that be through marketing, social media, technology, or just thinking of new solutions to everyday problems, and at the academy I want to harness these passions and combine them in new and innovative ways. When I’m not at IYH, I love to work in the healthcare industry and in influencer marketing, as well as dance, play instruments, and travel. Additionally, I am a huge foodie so if you ever need a restaurant recommendation don’t hesitate to reach out! I love to watch anything sci-fi or marvel related, and my kryptonite is a movie soundtrack or anything by Hans Zimmer. I could watch The Princess Bride on repeat and am concerningly addicted to soul cycle. Finally and obviously, because my name has a T in it, I’m obsessed with tea - I’m currently training to be a tea sommelier and you can spot me around campus drinking one of my 15 cups of the day. Thanks for learning a little bit about me and I hope to meet you soon! :)\"},{name:\"Faith Wang\",headshot:\"\",funnyPhoto:\"\",bio:\"Hi, I'm Faith! I'm from the suburbs of Chicago, home of Portillo's and Culver's (the best food).  I've always loved sharing the stories of others whether it be through design, podcasts, or writing, and I'm excited to continue doing so at the Academy. In my free time, you can always find me sipping on an iced coffee or Red Bull, listening to a RadioLab podcast, and playing Animal Crossing (check out my island :)). One of my dreams is to work on a Radiolab-style podcast, so I'm always interested and looking out for wacky stories!\"},{name:\"Austin Li\",headshot:\"\",funnyPhoto:\"\",bio:\"People like to call me the dad of the group, especially within IY8. At home, however, I like to relax to jazz records, draw digital illustrations, as well as sketch out furniture ideas that I know I will never get around to building. Besides the things I do for work and class, I am an avid baker, with pies being my specialty. My most popular pie flavour is Juicy Blueberry and Strawberry and Red Wine pie, but I’ve also created my own cinnamon apple, honey pecan, and lemon meringue recipes as well.

I was born in London and grew up in Japan, Ecuador, South Africa, and the Philippines. I love to travel, hike, scuba dive, and explore different places with friends and family. My dream trip would be to go skiing in France. I am dying to go, but not sure I would be able to handle the cold temperatures. I like to play tennis and the piano, now being in LA, I am excited to get better at surfing.

My favorite recording artist is Bob Dylan, my favorite shows are those of Mike Schur’s, and I love watching classic films (Make Way for Tomorrow is my favorite recent watch). The thing I love doing most in the world is spending time with my family — whether going on a vacation or simply eating out with them.

People describe me as passionate, fun, resourceful, loyal, diligent, and both a leader and a team player. I like to think I look at the world differently and offer unique perspectives and solutions.
